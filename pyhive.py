# First pass at a single Pymagotchi.  CREATING LIFE! (-ish)
#
# Maybe stripped-down Maslo's hierarchy of needs?
#
# Physiological:
#  - food
#  - cleanliness
# Safety:
#  - ?
# Love/Belonging
#  - play
#  - treats
# Esteem
#  - ?
# Self-actualization
#  - I think perahps ... not


# How do I even do this?  Things change over time.  Count real time?

# Do I instantiate a class for each Pymagotchi?

# Wha is the master process?  Are there two?  To be true to the spirit of the
# comic, I'd need a process to create Pymagotchi, and a separate, unlreated
# one, to tend to their needs.  Otherwise it defeats the purpose.  The two need
# to be independent of one another, and the second needs to watch the
# Pymagotchi created by the first and handle their needs.

# Where to start?

# Oh, and lets not skip past the obvious here.  It's a hive, right?  IT NEEDS A
# QUEEN!
